# Real Time Bus Tracker
This application tracks all MBTA buses in real-time. You can choose any route from a drop down list and the buses on that route will be displayed and updated every 15 seconds. 

To run this, just download all the files from the repository and load the index.html in the web browser. However you need to change the Google Map API key to use your own. Right now, the API key is restricted. 

## Future Improvement
Many improvements can be done. A few top priorites would be:
- [] Add route search functionality
- [] Add Bus/Route alert functionality
- [] Add search based on position click. A click on the map would show all bus around that position.
